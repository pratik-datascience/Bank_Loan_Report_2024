# Bank_Loan_Report
## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize bank loan data to monitor lending performance, assess loan portfolio health, and identify key trends. By using SQL for data extraction and Excel for interactive dashboards, the project provides actionable insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, borrower risk (DTI), and loan quality (Good vs Bad Loans) to support data-driven decision-making.
